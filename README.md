### Typescript API Boilerplate for Node.js

The goal of this repo is to be a plain and simple, 
lightweight boilerplate for back-end API development with Typescript.

## Main Tools used (devDependencies):
* **Sucrase**: high speed typescript build for development
* **TSC & Uglify-js**: Typescript builder & minifier for production
* **Eslint & Prettier**: Typescrit linting and code enforcing


## Dependencies (the ones that I use the most): 
* **cors**
* **express**
* **mongoose**

## Testing:
* **ESBUILD**: high speed javascript & typescript bundler and minifier written in GO

### todos:

- [x] <del>high speed builder for development</del> 
- [x] <del>ready to go typescript optimized builder for production</del>
- [ ] unit testing ready
